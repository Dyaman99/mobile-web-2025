            <h2>Feedback 1</h2>
            <h4>By Liliana Vallejo</h4>
            <p>She really liked the website overall. She asked if I could make a couple of links clickable so she could have a better customer experience. When she was reviewing the website, she spotted that on the mobile version of the website, the email sign-up form didn't look aesthetic because the sign-up button was below the line. This was one error we identified, and I needed to fix it. She also mentioned that the color of the special furniture section didn't match the overall color scheme of the website. She suggested that I try using a medium shade of blue or light gray to improve the visual appeal. </p>

            <h4>Sally Alazab</h4>
            <p>Sally told me that she believes the colors of the website goes pretty nicely together. I also showed her the sign up form and asked her opinion on how to fix it. She suggested that I could make the input field below the "Your email:" text and make the sign up button below that field to make it look nice. She also said it would look better if I added more padding to the section that contains the newsletter sign up. Overall she loved the website and the different breakpoints of the website.</p>
