            <h2>Feedback 1</h2>
            <h3>By Liliana Vallejo</h3>
            <p>She really liked the website overall. She asked if I could make a couple of links clickable so she could have a better customer experience. When she was reviewing the website, she spotted that on the mobile version of the website, the email sign-up form didn't look aesthetic because the sign-up button was below the line. This was one error we identified, and I needed to fix it. She also mentioned that the color of the special furniture section didn't match the overall color scheme of the website. She suggested that I try using a medium shade of blue or light gray to improve the visual appeal. </p>

            <h2>Feedback 2</h2>
            <h3>Sally Alazab</h3>
            <p>Sally told me that she believes the colors of the website goes pretty nicely together. I also showed her the sign up form and asked her opinion on how to fix it. She suggested that I could make the input field below the "Your email:" text and make the sign up button below that field to make it look nice. She also said it would look better if I added more padding to the section that contains the newsletter sign up. Overall she loved the website and the different breakpoints of the website.</p>

            <h2>Feedback 3</h2>
            <h3>My Brother: </h3>
            <p>The wesbite's overall theme looked really appealing, however, it felt empty when I noticed there were a bunch of pictures missing - placeholder picture placed - and the hyper links below the article pictures lacked proper design and css. Almost everything on the website scaled and adjusted really well along with the screen, however, the location/map icon in the nav and hyperlink dissapeared and bugged out. The sale slides did not loop infinitely. Lastly, the Design for a better tomorrow section felt out of place and cramed in. Overall, it was a well-prepared/styled and sophisticated website.</p>

            <h2>Addressing the Concerns/Issues</h2>
            <h3>How I fixed some style issues and errors</h3>
            <P>After getting feedback from these people, I tried my best to address all the issues. I made most of the links clickable by adding links to the sections on the page, and I also added a location page, so now when a user clicks the location icon, it takes them to a new page with an embedded map. I changed the colors of the articles in the special-collection section to match the site's theme more. I replaced all the image placeholders with actual images that are optimized for the website. I fixed the signup field using additional CSS.
            Furthermore, I styled the hyperlinks on the articles in furniture categories and special collection sections. They now look more like buttons. I also edited my "shop the sale" slides and made it an infinite loop, and turned on the autoplay. There was another bug in the location icon on the nav bar, and I was able to fix it with some effort. It did not go to the very left side of the nav bar, near the shopping cart icon, like I planned. I figured that the location icon was part of the flex that controls all of the navigation and was evenly spaced alongside all the other elements of the nav bar, such as the logo and the hamburger menu. I fixed it by using flexbox: I made the two icons (location and shopping cart) another flexbox inside the main flex, so now they were attached.</P>
